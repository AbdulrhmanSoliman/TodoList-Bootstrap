# Todo List App

This is a simple and elegant Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app uses Bootstrap for styling and FontAwesome for icons. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The app also supports dark mode and saves tasks in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Users can mark tasks as complete.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can switch between light and dark modes.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
